# Python-Projects
Just some programs I made for fun in Python.


"ForgotPW.py", "LoginPage.py", and "AddUserPW.py" are part of one project. Of course they can be combined, but I was playing around with using code from other files to create project.

Notes:

* If there is any error with the file holding login file. Please refer to line 24 of LoginPage.py

* To run the main file "LoginPage.py" on another file, please copy this:

    import LoginPage as login

    if login.done == True:
        
        #Do something
