# Python-Projects
Just some programs I made for fun in Python.


"ForgotPW.py", "PasswordPage.py", and "AddUserPW.py" are part of one project. Of course they can be combined, but I was playing around with using code from other files to create project.


To run the main file "PasswordPage.py" on another file, please copy this:

import PasswordPage as pwpage
if pwpage.done == True:
    print("")
